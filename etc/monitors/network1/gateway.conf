[monitor]
; currently i get errors when the service option is not spelled correct. error handling need to fix this. same for
; notifications and tasks.
service = net.FritzboxUplink
interval = 60
; notifications separated by ','. no whitespaces allowed. the case is not important.
notifications = sMs,EmaiL
; values from main configuration can be overridden for each defined monitor
; email_receivers separated by ','. no whitespaces allowed
email_receivers = admin@example.com,fallback@example.com
; sms_receivers separated by ','. no whitespaces allowed
sms_receivers = +number1,+number2
; setting to None fails. just do not set this option. currently i get an error when tasks is not set here. need to be
; fixed. setting it like below works but is no good design for optional options. same for notifications.
tasks = redis
; maybe this should be some kind of range too, for example for the ping service like: 10.0.0.1>10.0.0.42 or more
; sophisticated kind of ranges... i will find a solution for that... like host groups in the old version of Linspector
; so we don't need to add a monitor for each host... but it would be a good idea to expose these to hostgroups
; internally to single hosts to become a monitor for each host internally. some more ideas are in ;)
; hosts with added hostgroup defined in main configuration file
hosts = 192.168.0.1,192.168.23.24,@group1,@testgroup1
; monitors can add their self into a hostgroup
hostgroup = group1
user = USERNAME
password = PASSWORD
info = Cable Provider
; only alert when the error reaches the threshold
threshold = 3

; need to think about it but since Linspector does not know variables defined by a service, notification or task they
; need to be handed over as **kwargs dict. so i think it would be a good idea to put them here and just give over all
; these vars as a dict. for now only interval and service are know and even required arguments to get a service running.
