Things to do in no particular order:

- Implement error handling at all needed places! currently nearly no error handling is done!
- Configure the logger
- Make use of the logger wherever it us useful! and be informative when information really helps debugging the application!
- Multicore support when scheduling jobs with APScheduler
- Parent alerting (escalation)
- Core error alerting to [linspector]->members on internal errors
- Hostgroup parents (example: if the hostgroup "network" is down, don't alert for the hosts in that network)
- Add more services
- Add more tasks e.g. storage in mongodb or mariadb and some more notifications like XMPP and SMS
- Check for all required configuration options and set defaults in services.
- Write documentation and inline documentation.
- Add kwargs ro notifications, tasks and maybe plugins.
